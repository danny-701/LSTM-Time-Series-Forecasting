# LSTM-Time-Series-Forecasting
A hands-on project for forecasting time-series with PyTorch LSTMs. It creates realistic daily data (trend, seasonality, events, noise), prepares it with sliding windows, and trains an LSTM to make multi-step predictions. The project tracks errors with RMSE, MAE, MAPE and shows clear plots of training progress and forecast results.
